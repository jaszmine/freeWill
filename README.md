well boy do i have the program for you ♫♩♬ 

i give you: 222 lines of hardcoded 🙌 INNOVATION 👏 <3
your move zuckerberg.

## motivation
- i saw this instagram reel with something similar
- but it only showed like the first 10 lines of code
- and all the comments were in russian 
- so i made it work lol

## how to use
- start playing music video around 2:40
- run script when they say "A crowded room, friends with tired eyes" (around 2:42)
