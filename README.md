i give you: 244 lines of hardcoded 🙌 INNOVATION 👏 <3 <br>
your move zuckerberg.

## ✨ motivation ✨
- i saw this video with something similar, but it only showed like the first 10 lines of code
- and all the comments were in russian 
- so i made it work lol

## how to use
1) `pip install pydub simpleaudio` (or `pip3` if ur on a mac)
2) in the terminal, `python xmas.py` (or `python3` lol)
OR
